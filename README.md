# AutoDater for Obsidian

Automatically adds and maintains `Created` and `Updated` dates in the YAML frontmatter of your Obsidian notes.

## Why this plugin? ü§î

Have you ever lost valuable metadata like creation or modification dates when exporting notes, migrating between tools, or recovering from a backup? Standard file system metadata can be fragile.

This plugin solves that by embedding `Created` and `Updated` timestamps directly into the content of your notes within the YAML frontmatter. This ensures this important contextual information stays **with the note itself**, wherever it goes.

## How it Works / Features ‚ú®

* **Automatic `Created` Date:** When you create a **new note**, the plugin automatically adds:
    ```yaml
    ---
    Created: YYYY-MM-DD
    Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
    ---
    ```
    (Where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the current date). It **will not** modify existing files that lack these fields upon initial activation.
* **Automatic `Updated` Date:** Whenever you **modify an existing note**, the plugin:
    * Updates the `Updated:` field to the current date (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
    * If the `Updated:` field doesn't exist, it adds it.
    * If no YAML frontmatter exists at all, it creates the frontmatter block and adds the `Updated:` field.
* **Safe Updates:** The plugin carefully adds or updates fields without overwriting other existing YAML data. It's designed to be non-destructive.
* **Lightweight:** Designed to update efficiently without noticeable slowdowns during normal note-taking.
